## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#A0D2EB) to create a calming, focused writing environment, referencing the concentration and clarity needed for writing.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8), a desaturated version of the primary color to reduce distraction and provide a comfortable writing background.
- Accent color: Muted purple (#B39DDB) for highlighting key UI elements like active chapter titles and important formatting options, contrasting with the soft blue and gray.
- Body text and headline font: 'Literata', a serif font providing a vintage literary feel, making it suitable for long-form writing and chapter headings.
- Simple, outline-style icons for formatting options (bold, italics, underline) and chapter management (add, delete, reorder).
- Clean and distraction-free layout, with a clear separation between the chapter management sidebar and the main text editing area.
- Subtle transitions when opening/closing chapters and saving documents.
- Dark Theme: Dark background with light text for comfortable writing in low-light environments.
